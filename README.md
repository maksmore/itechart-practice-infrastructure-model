# iTechArt Practice Project

This is a representative model of the infrastructure that was developed by me during the iTechArt practice using such tool like *Terraform*.
It demonstrates the basis for building infrastructure in real projects.

## CI/CD

It also includes CI/CD processes implying a Git Flow approach, in which we had both a development branch and the main branch

## Techology

The practice project was based on Node.js technology. The main code of the project is protected by NDA and didn't get into this repository.
